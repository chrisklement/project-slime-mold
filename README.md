#Project Slime Mold

***First confrontation and encounter with computer vision, based on the behavior of slime mold and the first steps with Raspberry Pi 2.***

Normally one finds Physarum polycephalum in nature in a humid environment, on trees under the bark or in leaf litter in the forest, where they can feed on bacteria, fungal spores, and more. But we used the slime mold for an unpredictable experiment.

The first step of the project was to think about an experiment with the slime mold and implement this. Then the fungus had to be grown in petri dishes in order to last for several attempts. As the fungus is quick in its growth and the experiment should be recorded for 2-3 days, a recording setup had to be tinkered and programmed.

For the basis of my setup I used the following hardware:

* Raspberry Pi 2 Model B
* Raspberry Pi Camera Rev 1.3
* Adafruit GPIO Ribbon Cable
* Adafruit Assembled Pi Cobbler
* Breadboard
* 6x ultra bright white LEDs
* Various cables
* Box

I used Crontab for the automatic recording of the experiment, that activates the LEDs for a short moment and takes a picture every minute. After the experiment, the images are joined together to form a short clip.

##The Experiment

The mold is exposed on the side of the petri dish and it is to be observed:

* how the slime mold is responding on a 90Â° slope
* if he chooses the food by the lowest resistance
* whether the slime mold works from left to right

After several attempts, unfortunately I had to realize that the experiment has failed. However, I used the recovered material for the computer vision project with OpenCV.

In the following you can see my final result:
